When a plumbing emergency strikes in Hampstead, every minute counts. Whether it's a burst pipe flooding your property, a broken boiler in winter, or a blocked toilet, you need fast, reliable help.

## What to Do Before the Plumber Arrives

### For Burst Pipes or Major Leaks:
1. **Turn off main water supply** (usually under kitchen sink or in basement)
2. **Turn off water heater** to prevent damage
3. **Mop up water** to minimize damage
4. **Move valuables** away from leak
5. **Take photos** for insurance

### For Boiler Breakdowns:
1. Check if pilot light is out
2. Check thermostat settings
3. Verify power supply
4. Note any error codes
5. Don't attempt DIY repairs (dangerous!)

## How to Choose a Reliable Emergency Plumber

### Essential Checklist:
✅ **Gas Safe registered** (for boiler work)
✅ **Public liability insurance** (minimum £2 million)
✅ **Local to Hampstead** (faster response)
✅ **24/7 availability** (true emergencies don't wait)
✅ **Transparent pricing** (no hidden fees)
✅ **Verified reviews** (Trustpilot, Google, etc.)

### Red Flags to Avoid:
❌ Demanding large deposits upfront
❌ No physical address or landline
❌ Unlicensed or uninsured
❌ Vague pricing estimates

## Preventing Plumbing Emergencies

### Annual Maintenance Tasks:
- **Boiler service** (legally required for landlords, recommended for homeowners)
- **Drain cleaning** (prevent blockages)
- **Pipe insulation** (prevent freezing in winter)
- **Leak detection** (catch small problems early)

### Winter Preparation (Essential for Hampstead Properties):
Hampstead's elevated location makes properties vulnerable to freezing:

1. **Insulate pipes** in unheated areas (lofts, garages)
2. **Bleed radiators** annually
3. **Know where your stopcock is** (and ensure it works)
4. **Keep heating on** when away in winter (minimum 12°C)
5. **Drain outdoor taps** before first frost

## Why Choose Hampstead Maintenance for Emergency Plumbing?

### Our Emergency Promise:
🔧 **60-90 minute response** to NW3 emergencies
📞 **24/7 phone line** - real person, not voicemail
💰 **Transparent pricing** - quote before we start
✅ **Gas Safe engineers** - all certified and insured
🛠️ **Fully stocked vans** - fix it first visit

### What Sets Us Apart:

4. **Follow-up**: We check back to ensure the fix holds

## Common Hampstead Plumbing Issues

### Victorian/Georgian Properties:
- Lead pipe replacements
- Cast iron drain repairs
- Low water pressure (old pipes)
- Temperamental boilers in tight spaces

### Modern Apartments:
- Combi boiler pressure issues
- Shower mixer valve problems
- Dishwasher/washing machine connections
- Pressurized system faults

## Emergency Plumbing FAQs

**Q: Do I really need an emergency plumber at 2am?**
A: If water is actively flooding, or you have no heating in freezing weather, yes. For a dripping tap, it can wait until morning.

**Q: Will my insurance cover emergency plumbing?**
A: Many home insurance policies cover "trace and access" for hidden leaks. Check your policy. Keep all receipts and photos.

**Q: How long will the repair take?**
A: Simple repairs (tap washers, toilet valves): 30-60 minutes. Complex jobs (pipe replacements, boiler parts): may need return visit with parts.

**Q: Can I fix it myself to save money?**
A: Don't DIY gas work (illegal without Gas Safe certification) or major leaks. Simple tasks like replacing tap washers are usually safe.

## When to Call vs When to Wait

### Call Immediately (Emergency):
- Any gas smell
- Water flooding property
- No heating in freezing weather
- Sewage backup
- Water heater making banging noises

### Call Same Day (Urgent):
- Boiler pressure issues

**Q: Can I pay by card?**
A: Yes, we accept all major cards, contactless, and bank transfer. Cash if you prefer.

**Q: What if I need a new lock at 3am?**
A: Our vans carry common lock types. For specialist locks, we secure your property temporarily and return with correct parts.

## Locksmith Scams to Avoid in London

### Common Tactics:
1. **Bait-and-Switch Pricing**: Quote £40 on phone, charge £400 on arrival
2. **Unnecessary Drilling**: Claim lock can't be picked (95% can be)
3. **Fake Emergencies**: Suggest your lock is dangerously insecure when it's fine
4. **Overcharging Elderly**: Target vulnerable residents with inflated prices

### How to Protect Yourself:
- Get written quote before work starts
- Never pay cash without receipt
- Check company online reviews (Trustpilot, Google)
- Ask for breakdown of charges
- Request company registration number

## Prevent Future Lockouts

### Smart Solutions:
- **Key safes** - hide spare in secure coded box (£30-£80)
- **Smart locks** - unlock with phone, code, or fingerprint (£150-£400)
- **Trusted neighbor** - leave spare key with someone local
- **Keyless entry** - biometric or code-based systems

### Don't:
❌ Hide keys under mat (burglars check here first)
❌ Label keys with address
❌ Leave spare in "secret" garden spot (easy to find)
❌ Ignore sticking locks (fix before full failure)

## When to Change Your Locks

### Essential Times to Change:
- **After moving** into new property (who else has keys?)
- **Lost or stolen keys** (immediate security risk)
- **After break-in** (locks may be damaged/compromised)
- **Relationship breakdown** (regain control of property access)
- **Lodger moves out** (revoke their access)

### Recommended Intervals:
- **UPVC mechanisms**: Every 5-7 years
- **Euro cylinders**: Every 8-10 years
- **Mortice locks**: 10-15 years (unless damaged)
- **Smart locks**: Upgrade every 5 years (technology advances)
